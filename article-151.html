      <h1>Commodore 1541-II Floppy Drive Repair</h1>
      <p>
        I was able to repair my Commodore 1541-II floppy drive, which is typically used together with the Commodore 64.<br />
        <br />
        The first problem was that I do not have the original (external) power supply, but fortunately it uses fairly standard +5V and +12V voltages, which are also used by most PC hardware. So I made an adapter from a 4-pin molex to a 4-pin DIN connector:<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        The pinout of the DIN connector can be found <a href="http://www.the-liberator.net/site-files/retro-games/hardware/Commodore-1541-II-Floppy-Drive/commodore-1541-ii-floppy-drive-rev-7.htm">here</a> among other places.<br />
        <br />
        When powering up the drive for the first time, it would keep the drive motor running constantly, which is apparently a known problem. Some other people online said this could be caused by a faulty PSU or bad ROM chip...<br />
        <br />
        When I attempted to continue troubleshooting the next day, the situation had worsened. Now the power LED on the drive would flash a little on power on and slowly fade away. Symptoms of a short circuit or something perhaps...<br />
        <br />
        With no idea on what to do about this, I decided to try to replace the electrolytic capacitors, which people often do on restoration/repair projects.<br />
        <br />
        There are only three of them on the main board, all 10uF and 25V, located here:<br />

      <p>
        <br />
        To my surprise, this actually worked, and the drive is now working:<br />

      <p>
        <br />
        I have a theory: Two of those capacitors I changed are between the incoming 12V/5V and ground, acting as &#34;decouping/bypass&#34; to filter out noise. If there happened to be a short circuit or weakened resistance in the capacitors, that would explain parts of the symptoms at least.<br />
        <br />
