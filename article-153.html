      <h1>Linux Distribution for 386SX</h1>
      <p>
        I have a Commodore PC 50-II system with a Intel 386SX CPU running at 16MHz and only 5MB of RAM, in addition, the harddrive controller and harddrive is also missing. To get around this, I have installed a 3Com 3C509B-TPO ISA Network card and have managed to boot Linux on this ancient PC over the network instead.<br />
        <br />
        At first I tried to use Buildroot, but I had to give up on this in the end, as it seems that pure 386 is not supported anywhere anymore. So instead, I have gone the route of building everything from scratch, so I could pick and choose specific source versions of GCC and the Linux kernel that supports 386 with math emulation. The end result is a cross-compiling toolchain for i386, a stripped down kernel and Busybox-based rootfs mounted over NFS from another host computer.<br />
        <br />
        I ended up using these specific software versions:<br />
        * linux-2.4.37.9<br />
        * gcc-3.4.6<br />
        * busybox-1.01<br />
        * uClibc-0.9.33.2<br />
        * binutils-2.32<br />
        <br />
        I also had to statically link everything. I tried with dynamic linking in the beginning but the system would hang during boot, and I didn&#39;t want to troubleshoot this any further.<br />
        <br />
        I have made some scripts to greatly simplify the whole process of building the cross-compiling toolchain and all the binaries. Bundled in a file <a href="supplies/linux-386sx.tar.gz">here</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Unpack this into a directory and then simply run the following:<br />
      </p>
        <div class="box">
          <pre>
./build.sh
./rootfs.sh
          </pre>
        </div>
      <p>
        I have used these on a Slackware 14.2 box with GCC 5.3.0<br />
        The result will be a directory with the &#34;rootfs&#34; and a &#34;bzImage&#34; located inside the kernel build tree.<br />
        <br />
        The rootfs is exported over NFS in /etc/exports like this:<br />
      </p>
        <div class="box">
          <pre>
/home/nfs/rootfs *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash,no_subtree_check)
          </pre>
        </div>
      <p>
        Also note that the legacy NFSv2 protocol needs to be actived!<br />
        <br />
        To prepare the kernel is the tricky part. To load it over TFTP with Etherboot you have to use the mkelf-linux script from the mknbi package. This package is not compilable on modern Linux distributions, so I ended up compiling and using it from an old Slackware 11.0 installation running in a QEMU virtual machine.<br />
        <br />
        I used the command as follows:<br />
      </p>
        <div class="box">
          <pre>
mkelf-linux --output=pc50linux.nb --ip=&#34;192.168.0.3:192.168.0.2:192.168.0.1:255.255.255.0:pc50&#34; --append=&#34;root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=/home/nfs/rootfs&#34; bzImage
          </pre>
        </div>
      <p>
        Where .3 is the booted client PC, .2 is the NFS server and .1 is the gateway and TFTP server.<br />
        <br />
        The final step is to activate the TFTP/DHCP server. I used dnsmasq for this, with the following relevant configuration:<br />
      </p>
        <div class="box">
          <pre>
dhcp-host=00:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff,192.168.0.3,infinite,set:pxelinux
enable-tftp
tftp-root=/var/ftpd
dhcp-boot=net:pxelinux,/var/ftpd/pc50linux.nb,boothost,192.168.0.1
          </pre>
        </div>
      <p>
        <br />
        Some additional information: I have no Boot ROM on the Ethernet card, so I used a floppy disk to actually kick-start the network booting. More specifically, the &#34;3c509.dsk&#34; image made from compiling parts of the <a href="http://etherboot.org/wiki/download">&#34;Etherboot&#34; package</a>. Since this also isn&#39;t compilable on modern distributions, I had to use the Slackware 11.0 QEMU virtual machine again.<br />
