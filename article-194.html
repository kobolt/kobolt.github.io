      <h1>lazyboNES Emulator</h1>
      <p>
        Here is a special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">NES</a> emulator made for the specific purpose of playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.">Super Mario Bros</a> with text-based graphics, that is, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)">curses</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The NES graphics is based around a background of 32 by 30 tiles, each 8x8 pixels. This emulator maps each tile to a character in the terminal and you need to resize it to at least 32x30 for everything to fit. In addition to the text based interface, an <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</a> based graphical output can also be run in parallel. Sound and joystick input will always be provided by SDL2, even when running only in text mode.<br />
        <br />
        Although it is technically possible to play with the keyboard directly into the terminal, it is highly recommended to play with a joystick/gamepad instead. Using the keyboard into the terminal means that all input is fed into a non-blocking &#34;standard in&#34; stream, which makes key combinations impossible. E.g. when walking and then jumping, the walk key will get &#34;unpressed&#34; causing Mario to stop.<br />
        <br />
        The emulator is very specific to Super Mario Bros since the characters are directly mapped to its <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=PPU_pattern_tables">pattern tables</a>. Other games, even if they start, will probably look really bad. Internally NTSC timings are used, so maybe only the USA version will work.<br />
        <br />
        Several shortcuts have been made with regards to the emulation. The PPU (graphics) emulation only supports horizontal scrolling and no vertical scrolling. PPU background/sprite priority is also not implemented, so sprites are always drawn on top of the background. Rendering on the edges is also not hidden away. APU (sound) emulation supports pulse/triangle/noise channels but not the DMC channel, and due to lack of filters and such the sound quality is far from perfect.<br />
        <br />
        The joystick/gamepad is detected on startup if connected, but the button mapping is hardcoded, so edit the source and re-build to change it. Save and load of the state is supported but only in one slot and only in memory, so it&#39;s not saved when quitting the emulator.<br />
        <br />
        6502 CPU emulation is a modified version from my <a href="article-177.html">Commodore 64 emulator</a> so it contains BCD mode which is not actually present on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricoh_2A03">Ricoh 2A03</a> used in the NES. Ctrl+C in the terminal will break into a debugger where various data can be dumped, including a CPU trace if compiled.<br />
        <br />
        Here is picture of both the curses and SDL2 graphic outputs running in parallel:<br />

        <br />
        The first version of the source code is available <a href="supplies/lazybones-0.1.tar.gz">here</a>, but it has also been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/kobolt/lazyboNES">GitHub</a> for possible future developments.<br />
