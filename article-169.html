Warning: Be careful when working with power supplies, they can contain dangerous voltages even when in powered off state.</p>

        I have gotten hold of a Gould DRO 1604 oscilloscope from 1989. It would power on, but the display was severely distorted and looked like this:<br />
      </p>
      <img class="border" src="images/gould_1604_before.jpg" alt="Gould 1604 Before" />
      <p>
        <br />
        I cracked open the case and first of all removed a leaking battery, which is not related to the display problem, but important to fix as soon as possible:<br />

        <br />
        Luckily there is a service manual available for this particular oscilloscope, which helps a lot in giving troubleshooting tips and places to measure. I first discovered that pin 4 of U803 (the Y DAC chip) had -3.3V but the service manual said it should be either -2.8V or -4.2V, depending on the &#34;dot joining&#34; state. This led me to Q811 (a MOSFET controlling the &#34;dot join&#34;) which had a strange voltage of -3.41V on it&#39;s gate, where it should have been either 0V or -5V. According to the circuit diagram the gate of Q811 is pulled by a resistor connected to the -12V power rail.<br />
        <br />
        I measured the -12V rail, and this was only around -11V which is too low. This rail is controlled by a LM377T linear regulator, which is adjusted by a set of resistors and capacitors. I checked the three associated resistors R1, R2 and R16 and they all had the correct values. However, the two capacitors C15 and C16 had correct capacitance but horrible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_series_resistance">ESR</a> value of 23 and 33 ohms.<br />
        <br />
        Here are the two bad capacitors, with blue casing:<br />

        <br />
        Which i promptly replaced with new ones:<br />

      <p>
        <br />
        This fixed the -12V power rail, which now measures around actual -12 volts, and the display is now working:<br />
